# BrokerCheck
I am SOOOO proud of this project! Normally, a project like this would take a few days (probably more than a week) to scrape everything using selenium. This is because I was just using one selenium page at a time. Instead, I multithreaded the project and it took about 2.5 hours (96 searches per minute from a few trials I ran). I split the project into 13 different files and injected code into each one. Then, I multithreaded importing them all, taking advantage of __import__() instead of import. I know a few ways that I could have made this project more efficient, but it actually turned out really well.
